Motivation 

This bot was created when we, the creators, struggled with timing the market properly, mainly missing out on buying the stock at a price that we had decided on based on prior research, before it quickly rose. Also, for the more popular stocks, such as Facebook or Apple, they reside in the US markets, with significantly different stock market opening hours as compared to us in Singapore, and thus we are unable to buy the stocks at conventional timings.
